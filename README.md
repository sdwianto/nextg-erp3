## üîß Port Configuration & Development Setup

### **Consistent Port Management**
Untuk menghindari konflik port dan memastikan konsistensi, sistem menggunakan konfigurasi port yang terpusat:

#### **Port Configuration**
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Port 3002
- **Backend (Express + tRPC)**: Port 3001
- **WebSocket**: Port 3001 (same as backend)
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Port 5432

#### **Quick Setup**
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd nextg-erp1

# 2. Setup dengan port yang konsisten
# Linux/Mac
chmod +x scripts/setup-ports.sh
./scripts/setup-ports.sh

# Windows
scripts\setup-ports.bat

# 3. Start development servers
npm run dev:all  # Start keduanya sekaligus
```

#### **Manual Setup**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Setup environment
cp env.local.template .env.local
# Edit .env.local dengan konfigurasi database

# 3. Setup database
npm run db:generate
npm run db:seed

# 4. Start servers
npm run dev        # Frontend (port 3002)
npm run dev:server # Backend (port 3001)
```

#### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Port Configuration
FRONTEND_PORT=3002
BACKEND_PORT=3001

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/nextgen_erp"

# Auto-calculated URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3002
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001
```

#### **Available Scripts**
```bash
npm run dev        # Start frontend only (port 3002)
npm run dev:server # Start backend only (port 3001)
npm run dev:all    # Start both servers concurrently
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run start      # Start production server
```

#### **Troubleshooting Port Issues**
```bash
# Check port usage
wsl ss -tulpn | wsl grep :3001  # Backend port
wsl ss -tulpn | wsl grep :3002  # Frontend port

# Kill processes on specific port
wsl kill $(wsl lsof -ti:3001)  # Kill backend
wsl kill $(wsl lsof -ti:3002)  # Kill frontend

# Restart servers
npm run dev:all
```
