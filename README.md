### **Technical Implementation**

#### **API Integration Layer**
```typescript
// Example: Integrated API endpoints
interface ProcurementToAssetAPI {
  // Purchase Order to Asset
  createAssetFromPurchaseOrder(poId: string): Promise<Asset>
  updateInventoryFromReceipt(receiptId: string): Promise<void>
  
  // Maintenance to Inventory
  reservePartsForMaintenance(maintenanceId: string): Promise<void>
  consumePartsFromMaintenance(maintenanceId: string): Promise<void>
  
  // Asset Lifecycle
  calculateAssetDepreciation(assetId: string): Promise<void>
  trackAssetMaintenance(assetId: string): Promise<void>
}
```

#### **Event-Driven Architecture**
```typescript
// Example: Event handlers for integration
class IntegrationEventHandler {
  // Purchase Order Events
  onPurchaseOrderApproved(poId: string) {
    // Trigger asset creation workflow
    // Update inventory planning
    // Notify maintenance team
  }
  
  // Inventory Events
  onInventoryLow(productId: string) {
    // Check maintenance schedules
    // Trigger reorder if needed
    // Alert maintenance team
  }
  
  // Maintenance Events
  onMaintenanceScheduled(equipmentId: string) {
    // Reserve required parts
    // Update inventory planning
    // Notify procurement team
  }
}
```

#### **Real-time Data Synchronization**
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates across modules
- **Database Triggers**: Automatic data consistency
- **Cache Management**: Optimized performance for real-time operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling concurrent updates
